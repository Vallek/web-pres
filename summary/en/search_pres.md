## Why it is important to know how to search for information

In my teaching practice, I often meet students (and not only students:) who underestimate the importance of searching for information. Some even consider it something shameful, like a real specialist should keep everything in his head. Someone thinks that all the necessary knowledge and answers to questions should be collected in one place. I hope I can explain to you why this is not the case.

But, even those students and beginners who understand all of this often don't know exactly where exactly you should not look for information. And how to do it more efficiently. Theses are the main topics of the lecture.

### Why it is important to search for information

The exchange and search for information is the basis of the Internet. It's hard to imagine working in development without using web. The same can be said about the education process. Knowledge sharing is the basis of learning. At the same time, without searching for information on your own there can be no high-quality education. Why?

#### First reason

There is too much information. Web development is constantly updated, and at the same time something becomes outdated. Especially in frontend. New tools and materials appear, standards and methods of work are updated, trends change. By the way this is why it's important to choose narrower areas of study and work. No one is able to learn and know everything. Regardless of where and how you study: by yourself, on courses, as an intern it is impossible to collect all the information about any profession in one place.

#### Second reason

Everyone are different. In web development, there is always a room for different approaches and ways of solving problems. In this variety of opinions and solutions, you will need to look for those that will help you in your specific task. That's why it is more efficient to collect useful information from all available sources and discard what's not working.

#### There's no shame in googling, only in not googling :)

There is nothing wrong with googling answers to questions. Moreover, it is absolutely necessary for any good specialist. Whether you are a student, a beginner or a pro with 20 years of experience. This is true for teachers too :)

it doesn't matter which search engine you use. Although they can show different results and if you didn't find something in one, check another.

### Why it's important to search for information *effectively*

But just looking for information is not enough. Like any other professional skill, this one can be leveled up. Why is it important?

#### + to knowledge

Not only is there too much information and it is constantly changing. In addition, not all information is equally useful :) There is a lot of outdated or incorrect information on the web. The skill of searching for information can work like a filter. At first it will be loose and you will let a lot of unnecessary stuff. This is normal and it is better to prepare yourself for it in advance. But if you will search, learn new things and practice, this filter will become more accurate. Then you will be able to weed out the unnecessary info and take only the useful.

#### + to competitive

When applying for a job, the skill of searching for information will help you complete test tasks on time and better than others. But in real work you will also have 100 questions a day. Some you will be able to ask your senior comrades or the teacher during courses. But for the most part, you'll have to find it yourself. And in the future less experienced colleagues will ask you something.

#### + to time savings

The faster you search for the information you need, the more you saving our most valuable resource - time. Faster is not about typing fast, but about knowing where and how best to look.

#### + to perspective

It is always more efficient to look at the solution of a problem from different points of view. Thousands of specialists will find problems and ways to solve them much faster then one. At the same time there are enough not most useful advices out there. The search skill will help you find what will help you in your task.

### Always be critical

Be critical of any information. Including this one :) Critical - does not mean not to trust anyone. It means test everything in practice. The best thing to do with new information is to open the code editor and try to reproduce the solution.

If you tested everything and it worked out well - great :) If not, then maybe you made a mistake. And this is normal and even useful while you are learning. 

But maybe something was wrong with the source. Therefore, in addition to practice, it is important to compare different sources. It is best to find out which are reliable and which are not.

## What sites you can trust and what sites you shouldn't

### The first doesn't mean the best

If something is in the first results of a search engine, it does not mean that it is the best source. Often, sites can break into the first results due to SEO (not always honest) or due to their age. Therefore, in the first lines there may be unreliable and whether outdated sites.

### What does obsolete information mean?

Everything on the web is changing very quickly. Therefore, by the way, books are not the most reliable source of information for a web developer (especially for a frontend dev). You can roughly define "outdated" in frontned like this: if the material was written before 2014-2015, then most likely it is outdated (of course, there may be exceptions). Around 2014, flexbox layout was released in its modern version. The newer one - grid - even later. Modern JS (ES6) started at 2015. This means that if you opened material from 2008, it was written about a very different web. If material is older than a few years, then read with caution and check with other sources. It is always good to do so anyways.

This is all true primarily for information retrieval. Interactive exercises are a separate topic. But older ones may also contain errors and outdated information.

### Trusted and untrusted sites

The following are examples of sources (usually popular ones) sorted by reliability. This is a relative division. Some sites may fall into different categories. This is also a subjective opinion of the author, but on the other hand, it is based on specific observations.

#### Unreliable

##### [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp)

A very old popular site. Previously contained a huge number of errors. There was even a site that compiled a list of these errors. Since then they have improved a lot. But still there is questionable info (layout on floats, dubious css library, inline/block as part of html not a css).

##### [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org)

Often simplified, copywriting style articles.

##### [delftstack](https://www.delftstack.com/)
Outdated data.

##### SEO sites

There are many low-quality sites on the web created for SEO, copying someone else's content or "AI" generated.

##### Non-core sites

There are a lot of sites that have info on development but not really created by professionals. For example QnA sites on broad topics (not to be confused with QnA sites for devs). You should not read at all about something related to development there. [Example] (https://blog.hubspot.com/website/what-is-css-class8606) of a very surface level article.

#### Different reliability

This category mainly includes sites with content created by users. The quality of materials as expected could vary heavily. Such sites can also differ from each other in terms of reliability and other qualities.

##### Wikipedia

Good for finding knowledge in which there is not much room for opinions. For example, it is good for finding out when different versions of the programming language came out.

Example of useful articles:
* [JavaScript Versions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#Versions)
* [Comparison of browser engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_browser_engines)
* [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS)
* [RGB Color Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model)

Pay attention to the banners on top of the pages and look in the "Discussion" section. If you see heated debates, then the article should be read with redoubled vigilance. At the end of the articles, you can find links to different websites. You can also use wiki to find official site or specs.

##### Blogs and websites

Sites and blogs from different authors. The content is very dependent on the author/authors/editors. If you find a useful article, then it makes sense to bookmark the author's site or RSS feed.

An example of useful posts on copyright sites:
* [geddski about the difference between width and flex-basis](https://gedd.ski/post/the-difference-between-width-and-flex-basis/)
* [List Apart about scope in JS](https://alistapart.com/article/fixing-variable-scope-issues-with-ecmascript-6/)
* [How auto value works](https://ishadeed.com/article/auto-css/)
* [Flexbox and absolute positioning](https://www.chenhuijing.com/blog/flexbox-and-absolute-positioning/)

##### Twitter

There are lots of web developers on Twitter, especially front-end developers. Sometimes you catch an interesting link, learn about a new tool or event.

##### [dev.to](https://dev.to/)

The modern social network for web developers.

##### [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)

The most popular collective blog on web. On all topics that you can and cannot imagine. Mostly consists of links, shorts posts questions and discussions. Sometimes in the comments you can find more useful information that in post itself:)

##### medium.com

Popular collective blog. Less social than reddit. Lots of good articles about layout and web development. There are communities that publish articles by different authors on topics. The freecodecamp community used to be part of the medium and now their articles are on [a separate site](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/). 

Medium Communities examples:

## Information search methods

When these links are not enough.

### Ask questions yourself!

Sooner or later there will be no ready answer to your question. Do not be afraid or shy or lazy to ask questions yourself on any of the sites created for this.

At the same time, if you want to get an answer to your question as quickly as possible, you should formulate it to avoid misunderstanding as well as you can. Learn to formulate the question as specifically and clearly as possible. Remember that those who will try to answer it do not sit next to you, do not know your computer, software, settings, don't see what you see and don't know what you know. In other words, people can't read mind :)

### Look for things that real people might write

Search engines, no matter how perfect and "smart" they are, one way or another search for existing content. And if you want to find text written by real people, you should think about how exactly they could formulate it. It's not easy, but comes with practice.

Don't give up if you didn't find the answer right away! Try changing the request.

An example from my experience. How to make BEM color themes. First "bem themes". Then "bam color themes".

### Different languages

Frontend is popular all over the world! There are many great sources of information in different languages. If your native language is not English you can probably find some additional info on it. For example there are tons of info in author's native Russian. Sometimes you might see some foreign article in google results. You can also use translation services like Google Translate to at least understand the gist of it.

### The more precise the query, the fewer results. But the easier it is to filter them

Try different approaches. If the results are too broad and far from your task, try a more specific query. If there are too few results, then the other way around.

### The ability to distinguish a normal source from a dubious one only comes with experience

There is no universal way to understand whether a site is reliable or not. But there are a number of things worth paying attention to.

* Dates of publications (but they may not correspond to the date of the content itself)
* Too many value judgments and emotions
* Something that contradicts reliable sources
* Sometimes it's site design. If it looks like a site from 1998, then maybe the content matches. But that's not a rule, just something to pay attention to.

### Search in all available formats

#### Text

The easiest way is to search text. It is the oldest information format on the web. There are certain sites on which you will not be able to search for text. These are some social networks and other modern apps-like sites.

#### Images

You can also search by images. Many things are easier to understand from infographic, diagrams or gifs. If you find a high-quality image on Google, check the site itself, maybe it's also good.

#### Video

Videos are harder to search because it's hard to skip parts. But there are useful videos from conferences or just from YouTubers who share experience.

#### Audio

Podcasts. In terms of search, it's about the same as a video, but even harder to evaluate quickly.

## Additional tips

### Search engines and site search

You can add search engines to your browser to save even more time. This works not only for big search engines, but also for different sites  with in-house search. For example: mdn, wikipedia, wiktionary, google translator.

### Site search via Google

If there is no normal search on the site, you can replace it with Google.

Just google "query site:site_address". For example "font-style site:https://en.bem.info". But it will search for words separately. To make it search for words together, use one of the basic tricks - wrap the words in quotes "font-style".

### Search engines features

In Google search and other search engines, you can use so-called operators - special characters that refine the query. The main Google operators can be found in the [official documentation](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en).

There are others besides those listed. For example, the character "*" can be used as "wild card". That is, instead of an asterisk, there can be any word. For example, a query in quotation marks "we * house" might return "we bought a house" and "we see a house".

### If it's on the web, it might disappear

Any page or its contents on the web can disappear. Maybe the author didn't pay for hosting, or the site is blocked in your country, or the image hosting is down, or the author will simply abandon the site and decide to close it.
Therefore, the most valuable materials that you might need are worth saving. Locally or on a server that you control. Or at least on a more reliable cloud service.

But if you already late to save info, several services that save the web can help you.

* [Google Cache (after the colon you need to put the address of the missing page)](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:)
* [Largest web archive](https://web.archive.org/)

Save knowledge locally in a knowledge base. To create it, you can use note-taking applications, CMS, or special programs. You can try [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/). It's free and open source.</p>
